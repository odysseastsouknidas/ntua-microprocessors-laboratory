This repository contains our solutions for the lab exercises of the [Microprocessors Laboratory Course](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/gr/undergraduate/courses/3213).

The course focuses on embedded programming using an AVR microcontroller on a custom NTUA board (ntuAboard_G1), employing both C and AVR Assembly.

It explores key microcontroller features such as interrupts and hardware timers, and covers interfacing with various peripherals including ADCs, LCD displays, PCA9555 I/O expanders, keyboards, and temperature sensors, as well as communication protocols like the Two-Wire Serial Interface (TWI/I²C).
